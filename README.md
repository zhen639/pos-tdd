### Get started with POS-TDD in Jasmine

First you need to clone this repo to you local machine

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:zhen639/pos-tdd.git
```

Write your function in src/main.js.

Then run SpecRunner.html to check your code.

If pass, you should refactor your code and write the second test for me. 

GOOD LUCK

You've done nice work for your first test and the revised answer for test1.
Now I've committed 'test2.several inputs of the same barcode' for you. Hope you'll enjoy finishing it.

Using Firebug for debugging, plz.
It's easy to install and use, just google it.

Tips:
Try to set break points for debugging in Firebug.
